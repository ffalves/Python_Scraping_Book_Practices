I started studying web scraping following some tutorials, courses and books.
I took Datacamp's course but it wasn't productive for me. I followed the whol XPATH and CSS Locator parts and I've learned new things, but when it came to using Scrapy Lib, everything became quite confusing and less reproducible in real life, so I completed the course but I didn't feel satisfactory.
Now, I reading Web Scraping with Python's book* and I'm going to save the practices and studies here in this repo.
